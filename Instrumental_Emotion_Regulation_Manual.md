## **4. Participant Arrival**

### **Before Entering the Testing Cubicle**
1. Ask the participant to **store belongings in S5**.  
2. In A5, have them **read and sign** the **information sheet** and **consent form**.  
3. Check that the **consent form is signed**.  
4. Ask participant to **tie up hair** (if applicable).  
5. Go into the testing cubicle while the participant waits in the hall.  
6. **Set up the PsychoPy experiment** to run.  
7. Record **Participant ID:** `_________________________`  
8. Ask participant to **hand over phone** (keep it safe).

## **5. Hook-Up Procedure**

### **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**
#### **Explanation**
> “A 3-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive procedure that measures the electrical activity of the heart muscle.”

#### **Preparation**
- Show **diagram** of electrode placement and explain connections.  
- If needed, provide **razor** for shaving small areas around electrode sites.  
- Wrap used razors in **paper and tape** before discarding in **general waste**.

#### **Electrode Placement Options**
- Participant can either:
  - Allow researcher to attach electrodes, **or**
  - Attach electrodes themselves with researcher guidance.

#### **If Researcher is Attaching**
1. **VIN- (white):** under right clavicle, midclavicular line.  
2. **GND (black):** lower right abdomen.  
3. **VIN+ (red):** lower left abdomen.  
4. Secure leads and route through clothing.

#### **If Participant is Attaching**
- Provide **instruction sheet** and confirm understanding.  
- Check electrode placement and correct color–lead matching.

#### **Electrode Prep**
- Peel **BIOPAC EL503 patch** backing.  
- Add a drop of **GEL104** if dry.  
- Ensure **SSLB lead** is connected to the correct Biopac MP36 channel.

### **Respiration Belt**
#### **Explanation**
> “The respiration belt records respiratory effort — in other words, your breathing.”

#### **Procedure**
1. Show **diagram** of placement.  
2. Have participant **stand**, face away, and raise arms.  
3. Strap belt **around chest**, above clothing.  
4. Instruct participant to:
   - **Exhale completely** → tighten belt (no looseness).  
   - **Inhale fully** → ensure **slight resistance** at full inhalation.  
5. Participant **sits down** in the testing chair.

---

### **Electrodermal Activity (EDA)**
#### **Explanation**
> “Electrodermal Activity (EDA) is a non-invasive measure of physiological arousal via skin sweat.”

#### **Procedure**
1. Show **diagram** of electrode placement.  
2. Identify **non-dominant hand**.  
3. Attach electrodes to **two fingers** of that hand.  
4. Ensure proper alignment and connection.  
5. Have participant place hand **palm down** and remain still.  

---

## **6. Final Pre-Experiment Checks**
- **Press Play** on Biopac → confirm data is recording.  
- Show how **movement affects data quality**.  
- Instruct participant to **stay still** during videos.  
- **Turn off Biopac monitor screen.**  
- **Start PsychoPy experiment.**  
- **Turn off lights** and leave the room.

## **7. After the Experiment**

### **Removing Equipment**
1. **Stop Biopac recording.**  
2. Ask participant to:
   - Remove **headphones**.  
   - Unclip **EDA electrodes** and remove pads.  
3. Researcher:
   - Unvelcro **respiration belt** and remove it.  
4. Participant removes **ECG electrodes** and pads.
